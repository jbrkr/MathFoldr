Thus, they led\\nto the construction of the nilpotent and periodicity theorems, which\\nprovided the first organization of the stable homotopy groups of spheres\\n(localized at a prime) into families of maps via chromatic homotopy\\ntheory.\\n\\nMathematical Context\\n\\nThe story begins with the degree p map on S¹ (as a circle in the complex\\nplane):\\n\\nS¹\\u2004→\\u2004S¹\\nz\\u2004↦\\u2004z^(p)\\n\\nThe degree p map is well defined for S^(k) in general, where k\\u2004∈\\u2004mathN.\\nIf we apply the infinite suspension functor to this map,\\nΣ^(∞)S¹\\u2004→\\u2004Σ^(∞)S¹\\u2004=\\u2004\\u2004:\\u2004𝕊¹\\u2004→\\u2004𝕊¹ and we take the cofiber of the resulting\\nmap:\\n\\n\\n\\nWe find that S/p has the remarkable property of coming from a Moore\\nspace (i.e., a designer (co)homology space: H^(n)(X)\\u2004≃\\u2004Z/p, and H̃^(*)(X)\\nis trivial for all \\u2005*\\u2005\\u2004≠\\u2004n).\\n\\nFormal definition\\n\\nThe nth Toda-Smith complex, V(n) where n\\u2004∈\\u2004{\\u2005−\\u20051,\\u20060,\\u20061,\\u20062,\\u20063,\\u2006...}, is a\\nfinite spectrum which satisfies the property that its BP-homology,\\nBP_(*)(V(n)):=[𝕊⁰,\\u2006BP\\u2005∧\\u2005V(n)], is isomorphic to BP_(*)/(p,\\u2006...,\\u2006v_(n)).\\n\\nThat is, Toda-Smith complexes are completely characterized by their\\nBP-local properties, and are defined as any object V(n) satisfying one\\nof the following equations:\\n\\n    BP_(*)(V(\\u2005−\\u20051))\\u2004≃\\u2004BP_(*)\\n    BP_(*)(V(0))\\u2004≃\\u2004BP_(*)/p\\n    BP_(*)(V(1))\\u2004≃\\u2004BP_(*)/(p,\\u2006v₁)\\n    etc.\\n\\nExamples of Toda-Smith complexes\\n\\n    the sphere spectrum, BP_(*)(S⁰)\\u2004≃\\u2004BP_(*), which is V(\\u2005−\\u20051).\\n    the mod p Moore spectrum, BP_(*)(S/p)\\u2004≃\\u2004BP_(*)/p, which is V(0)\\n\\nRelevance to stable homotopy theory\\n\\nIt may help the reader to recall that that BP_(*)\\u2004=\\u2004ℤ_(p)[v₁,\\u2006v₂,\\u2006...],\\n|v_(i)|\\u2004=\\u20042(p^(i)\\u2005−\\u20051).\\n\\nThe periodic maps, α_(t),\\u2006β_(t), and γ_(t), come from degree maps\\nbetween the Toda-Smith complexes, V(0)_(k),\\u2006V(1)_(k), and V(2)_(k)\\nrespectively.\\n\\n(… add in their relation to the v₂ periodic elements, and the reasoning\\nbehind the shift 2(p^(i)\\u2005−\\u20051))\\n',\n",
